Leverages JavaFX to create the application

To run the application navigate to build/dist/ 

and run 'desktop410.jar'

NOTE: You must have JRE 1.8 or higher to run the application.

First time using JavaFX. Code may not be the best. Leveraged a tutorial get going, most of the code was written on my own however.
